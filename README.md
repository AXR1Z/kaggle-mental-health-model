## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 🔍 Conducted deep **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify nulls, outliers, and inconsistent categories  
- 🛠️ Performed extensive **feature engineering** (e.g., City Tier, Profession Category, Degree Category, Sleep Quality Group)  
- 🧠 Built and fine-tuned **10+ classification models**:  
  - Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost  
  - Feedforward Neural Network using Keras  
- ⚙️ Used **Optuna** and **Keras Tuner** for hyperparameter optimization  
- 🤝 Employed **stacking**, **blending**, and **hill climbing** to ensemble models  
- 📊 Used correlation analysis and **SHAP values** for feature reduction and interpretability
